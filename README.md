Hi, Iâ€™m Abdelrahman, structural enginner and self taught web developer.  
My current stack is React with typescript and TailwindCSS on the frontend and NodeJS (Express) with Typescript and MongoDB or Postgres on the backend.  
Currently working on a hotels' booking web app clone using MERN stack, you can check out the [Frontend](https://github.com/mactav1sh/flyaway-frontend) and the [Backend](https://github.com/mactav1sh/flyaway-backend).
